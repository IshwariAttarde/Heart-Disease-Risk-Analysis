# 🫀 Cardiovascular Risk Intelligence Dashboard

An interactive **Power BI dashboard** designed to analyze **population-level heart disease risk, severity, and treatment outcomes** across different disease stages (Stage 0–Stage 4).

This project focuses on **risk stratification**, **patient profiling**, and **clinical insights** using key cardiovascular health indicators.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide.  
This dashboard enables **data-driven decision-making** by visualizing:

- Patient risk levels
- Disease stage progression
- Treatment patterns
- Demographic and clinical correlations

The dashboard dynamically updates across **heart disease stages**, helping identify how risk factors and outcomes evolve over time.

---

## 🧠 Key Objectives

- Analyze cardiovascular risk across disease stages  
- Identify high-risk patient groups  
- Compare treatment categories by severity  
- Understand the impact of age, BMI, cholesterol, BP, and lifestyle  
- Enable interactive exploration using slicers

## 📈 Dashboard Pages & Insights

### 🔹 Stage-wise Analysis (Stage 0 – Stage 4)

Each stage includes:

### ✅ KPI Cards
- **Total Patients**
- **Average BMI**
- **Average Risk Score**
- Comparison vs overall averages

### 📉 Visualizations
- **Risk Level Prevalence** (Low / Medium / High)
- **Heart Disease History Distribution**
- **Age Group Distribution**
- **Chest Pain Type Distribution**
- **Treatment Category Distribution**  
  (Lifestyle, Medication, Surgery)

### 🎛 Interactive Slicers
- Sex
- Smoking Status
- Physical Activity Level
- Patient ID

These slicers allow deep, customized analysis for different patient segments.
